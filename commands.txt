1. Hand-shaking (for serial port only)
   MASTER send 0x55 0x55 0x55 ... 0x55
   SLAVE reply 0xAA 0xAA 0xAA ... 0xAA
   MASTER can confirm that SLAVE is ready when receives 0xAA and can continue the communication.

2. Packet Format (in hex) between MASTER and SLAVE
   > MASTER Write Register:
     AA{DataLen=n}{RegAddr}{D0}{D1}...{Dn}{CRC8}
   > SLAVE ACK Write Register:
     55{DataLen=0}{RegAddr}{CRC8}
   > MASTER Read Register Request:
     AA{DataLen=0}{RegAddr}{CRC8}
   > SLAVE Reply Read Register Request:
     55{DataLen=n}{RegAddr}{D0}{D1}...{Dn}{CRC8}
